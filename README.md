# Simple Web-Based Snake Game

This is a simple snake game created with p5.js (web-based), inspired by the classic Snake game. It includes Xbox controller support and automatically scales to fit the screen.

The game uses a basic tile-based collision system and tracks the snake's position in an array, based on its length. If the snake goes off-screen or collides with its own tail, the game will reset.
